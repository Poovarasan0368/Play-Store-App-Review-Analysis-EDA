## Introduction ðŸ“–
Google Play Store or formerly Android Market, is a digital distribution service developed and operated by Google. It is an official apps store that provides variety content such as apps, books, magazines, music, movies and television programs. It serves an as platform to allow users with 'Google certified' Android operating system devices to donwload applications developed and published on the platform either with a charge or free of cost. With the rapidly growth of Android devices and apps, it would be interesting to perform data analysis on the data to obtain valuable insights.

## Problem Description ðŸ¤”  
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. Each app (row) has values for catergory, rating, size, and more. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the android apps. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for app engagement and success.

### The contents of Play Store Data are:
* **App:** Name of the app.
* **Category:** Category of the app. Some examples are: ART_AND_DESIGN, FINANCE, COMICS, BEAUTY etc.
* **Rating:** The current average rating (out of 5) of the app on Google Play.

## CONCLUSION âœŒ
